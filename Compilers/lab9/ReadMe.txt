Level: Function Calls


This is the final Compiler project for CS 370. I have chosen to be graded at level e for the function calls.

to recompile all the code feel free to use this line to assemble all the files

make && ./lab9 -o readwrite < readwrite.al && ./lab9 -o readwriteGlobal < readwriteGlobal.al && ./lab9 -o readwritearray < readwritearray.al && ./lab9 -o functest < functest.al &&./lab9 -o hello < hello.al && ./lab9 -o functioncall < functioncall.al

I have included a picture of the output of functest.asm as well

Thanks for the semester
